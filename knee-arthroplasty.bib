Clusters that contain collateral, identical characteristics in a dataset are grouped using reiterative techniques. As the data in real world is growing day by day so very large datasets with little or no background knowledge can be identified into interesting patterns with clustering. So, in this paper the two most popular clustering algorithms K-Means and K-Medoids are evaluated on dataset transaction10k of KEEL. The input to these algorithms are randomly distributed data points and based on their similarity clusters has been generated. The comparison results show that time taken in cluster head selection and space complexity of overlapping of cluster is much better in K-Medoids than K-Means. Also K-Medoids is better in terms of execution time, non sensitive to outliers and reduces noise as compared to K-Means as it minimizes the sum of dissimilarities of data objects.},

   abstract = {Background Multiple authors have sought to determine what patient characteristics influence outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The impact of gender on outcomes after TKA remains controversial. Previous studies had less than 5 years of follow-up after TKA. The aim of this evaluation was to determine what differences in pain, function, and quality of life (QoL) exist between female and male patients 5 years after primary TKA. Methods A prospective, multicenter cohort of 11,602 unilateral primary TKA patients (7,284 females and 4,318 males) was prospectively evaluated. All patients were enrolled in the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement. Demographic data, musculoskeletal and medical comorbid conditions, and patient-reported outcome measures, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) and Short-Form (36-item) Health Survey mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS) were collected preoperatively and at 5 years after TKA. Descriptive statistics were generated, and stratified by gender, and differences in pain, function, and QoL between female and male patients were evaluated. Multivariate regression models with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the role of patient gender as a predictive factor for KOOS pain and function in daily living (ADL) scores reported 5 years after primary TKA, while adjusting for other variables. Results Prior to surgery, female patients reported worse pain (KOOS pain 46 versus 52), function (KOOS ADL 53 versus 59), and QoL (KOOS QoL 26 versus 29) than male patients. The differences in preoperative scores ranged from 2.70 (KOOS QoL) to 6.12 (KOOS ADL). At 5 years after TKA, female patients reported slightly worse pain (87 versus 89), function (85 versus 87), and QoL (74 versus 75) when compared to male patients. The differences in the mean 5-year postoperative KOOS scores (range, 0.99 to 2.73), although statistically significant (P < .001), were clinically negligible. Female patients achieved greater improvement in pain (41 versus 37), function (32 versus 29), and QoL (48 versus 46) scores in comparison to male patients. Female patients also reported lower preoperative PCS global function (33 versus 35) scores, 5-year postoperative PCS scores (45 versus 46), and MCS global mental function scores (52 versus 54). Similarly, the differences in the 5-year postoperative Short-Form (36-item) Health Survey MCS and PCS scores were clinically negligible. Multivariate regression analysis showed that female gender was not independently predictive for either pain (β = −1.08; 95% CI [−1.25 to 1.03] [P = .85]) or function (β = 0.64; 95% CI [−0.51 to 1.79] [P = .28]) 5 years after surgery. Conclusions There are no clinically significant gender differences in pain, function, or QoL 5 years after TKA. Female patients typically have worse symptoms prior to surgery, improve more than male patients, and end up with pain, function, and QoL scores clinically equal to male patients. These data can enhance the shared decision-making process between female patients and surgeons and assist in setting appropriate patient expectations prior to TKA.},

   abstract = {Multiple imputation is a common technique for dealing with missing values and is mostly applied in regression settings. Its application in cluster analysis problems, where the main objective is to classify individuals into homogenous groups, involves several difficulties which are not well characterized in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a framework for applying multiple imputation to cluster analysis when the original data contain missing values. The proposed framework incorporates the selection of the final number of clusters and a variable reduction procedure, which may be needed in data sets where the ratio of the number of persons to the number of variables is small. We suggest some ways to report how the uncertainty due to multiple imputation of missing data affects the cluster analysis outcomes—namely the final number of clusters, the results of a variable selection procedure (if applied), and the assignment of individuals to clusters. The proposed framework is illustrated with data from the Phenotype and Course of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (PAC-COPD) Study (Spain, 2004–2008), which aimed to classify patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease into different disease subtypes.},

   abstract = {Summary Objective To estimate the future rate of primary total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement in the UK to 2035 allowing for changes in population demographics and obesity. Design Using age/gender/body mass index (BMI)-specific incidence rates from a population-based cohort study of 50,000 THR and 45,609 TKR patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1991 and 2010, we projected future numbers of THR and TKR using two models: a static, estimated rate from 2010 applied to population growth forecasts to 2035, and a log-linear rate extrapolation over the same period. Both scenarios used population forecast data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Results Assuming rates of THR and TKR for 2010, and given projected population changes in age, gender and BMI, the number of THRs and TKRs performed in the UK in 2035 is estimated to be, respectively: 95,877 and 118,666. By comparison, an exponential extrapolation of historical rates using a log-linear model produces much higher estimates of THR and TKR counts in 2035 at 439,097 and 1,219,362 respectively. Projected counts were higher for women than men. Assuming a changing (rather than fixed) future BMI distribution increases TKRs by 2035 but not THRs. Conclusions Using historical rates and population forecasts we have projected the number of THR/TKR operations in the UK up to 2035. This study will inform policymakers requiring estimates of future demand for surgery. Incorporating future forecasts for BMI into projections of joint replacement may be more relevant for TKR rather than THR.},

   abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) technology has been proposed as a method of improving post-discharge surveillance. Little is known about how mHealth has been used to track patients after surgery and whether its use is associated with differences in postoperative recovery.Three databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials) were searched to identify studies published between January 1999 and February 2021. Mobile health was defined as any smartphone or tablet computer capable of electronically capturing health-related patient information and transmitting these data to the clinical team. Comparable outcomes were pooled via meta-analysis with additional studies compiled via narrative review. The quality of each study was assessed based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.Forty-five articles met inclusion criteria. While the majority of devices were designed to capture general health information, others were specifically adapted to the expected outcomes or potential complications of the index procedure. Exposure to mHealth was associated with fewer emergency department visits (odds ratio 0.42, 95 per cent c.i. 0.23 to 0.79) and readmissions (odds ratio 0.47, 95 per cent c.i. 0.29 to 0.77) as well as accelerated improvements in quality of life after surgery. There were limited data on other postoperative outcomes.Remote home monitoring via mHealth is feasible, adaptable, and may even promote more effective postoperative care. Given the rapid expansion of mHealth, physicians and policymakers need to understand these technologies better so that they can be integrated into high-quality clinical care.A systematic review was performed to determine how mobile health (mHealth) technology is being used to track surgical patients after hospital discharge, and whether exposure to mHealth is associated with differences in postoperative recovery. Remote home monitoring via mHealth is feasible and flexible enough to meet the demands of a variety of patients and clinical teams. Exposure to mHealth also appears to be associated with a reduction in both emergency department visits and hospital readmissions as well as accelerated improvements in quality of life. mHealth represents an important next step in postoperative surveillance, although better performance data, targeted incentives and clearer guidelines are still needed.},

   abstract = {Summary Objective To characterize groups of subjects according to their trajectory of knee pain and function over 1 to 5 years post total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods Patients from one centre who underwent primary TKA (N = 689) between 2006 and 2008. The Knee Society Score (KSS) was collected pre-operatively and annually post-operatively. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to classify groups of subjects according to their trajectory of knee pain and function over 1–5 years post-surgery. Results LCGA identified a class of patients with persistent moderate knee pain (22.0%). Predictors (OR, 95% CI) of moderate pain trajectory class membership were pre-surgery SF12 mental component summary (MCS) per 10 points (0.65, 0.54–0.79) and physical component summary (PCS) per 10 points (0.50, 0.33–0.76), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) one (1.70, 1.07–2.69) and ≥two (2.82, 1.59–4.81) and the absence of computer-navigation (2.26, 1.09–4.68). LCGA also identified a class of patients with poor function (23.0%). Predictors of low function trajectory class membership were, female sex (3.31, 1.95–5.63), advancing age per 10 years (2.27, 1.69–3.02), pre-surgery PCS per 10 points (0.50, 0.33–0.74), obesity (1.69, 1.05–2.72), morbid obesity (3.12, 1.55–6.27) and CCI ≥two (2.50, 1.41–4.42). Conclusions Modifiable predictors of poor response to TKA included baseline co-morbidity, physical and mental well-being and obesity. This provides useful information for clinicians in terms of informing patients of the expected course of longer term outcomes of TKA and for developing prediction algorithms that identify patients in whom there is a high likelihood of poor surgical response.},

However, clinical studies suggest that a considerable number of patients continue to experience substantial pain and functional loss following surgical recovery. We aimed to estimate pain and function outcome trajectory types for persons undergoing KA, and to determine the relationship between pain and function trajectory types, and pre-surgery predictors of trajectory types. Design Participants were 384 patients who took part in the KA Skills Training randomized clinical trial. Pain and function were assessed at 2-week pre- and 2-, 6-, and 12-months post-surgery. Piecewise latent class growth models were used to estimate pain and function trajectories. Pre-surgery variables were used to predict trajectory types. Results There was strong evidence for two trajectory types, labeled as good and poor, for both Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain and Function scores. Model estimated rates of the poor trajectory type were 18% for pain and function. Dumenci's latent kappa between pain and function trajectory types was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61–0.80). Pain catastrophizing and number of painful body regions were significant predictors of poor pain and function outcomes. Outcome-specific predictors included low income for poor pain and baseline pain and younger age for poor function. Conclusions Among adults undergoing KA, approximately one-fifth continue to have persistent pain, poor function, or both. Although the poor pain and function trajectory types tend to go together within persons, a significant number experience either poor pain or function but not both, suggesting heterogeneity among persons who do not fully benefit from KA.},

Seven patients participated in a codesign focus group to set and prioritise the research direction. Narrative interviews were conducted with 20 patients.Results Patients perceived that an ERAS programme should not be limited to the perioperative period, but should encompass the journey from diagnosis to recovery. Practical recommendations to improve the patient experience across the surgical continuum, and enhance patient engagement within ERAS included: (1) fully explain every protocol, and the purpose of the protocol, both before surgery and while in-hospital, so that patients can become knowledgeable partners in their recovery; (2) extend ERAS guidelines to the presurgery phase, so that patients can be ready emotionally, psychologically and physically for surgery; (3) extend ERAS guidelines to the recovery period at home to avoid stressful situations for patients and families; (4) consider activating a programme where experienced patients can provide peer support; (5) one size does not fit all; personalised adaptations within the standardised pathway are required.Drawing upon these data, and through consultation with ERAS Alberta stakeholders, the ERAS team developed a matrix to guide sustained patient involvement and action throughout the surgical care continuum at three levels: individual, unit and ERAS system.Conclusion This patient-led study generated new insights into the needs of ERAS patients and informed the development of a framework to improve patient experiences and outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background Recovery following total joint arthroplasty is patient-specific, yet groups of patients tend to fall into certain similar patterns of recovery. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize recovery patterns following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using patient-reported outcomes that represent distinct health domains. We hypothesized that recovery patterns could be defined and predicted using preoperative data. Methods Adult patients were recruited from a large, urban academic center. To model postoperative responses to THA and TKA across domains such as physical health, mental health, and joint-specific measures, we employed a longitudinal clustering algorithm that incorporates each of these health domains. The clustering algorithm from multiple health domains allows the ability to define distinct recovery trajectories, which could then be predicted from preoperative and perioperative factors using a multinomial regression. Results Four hundred forty-one of 1134 patients undergoing THA and 346 of 921 undergoing TKA met eligibility criteria and were used to define distinct patterns of recovery. The clustering algorithm was optimized for 3 distinct patterns of recovery that were observed in THA and TKA patients. Patients recovering from THA were divided into 3 groups: standard responders (50.8%), late mental responders (13.2%), and substandard responders (36.1%). Multivariable, multinomial regression suggested that these 3 groups had defined characteristics. Late mental responders tended to be obese (P = .05) and use more opioids (P = .01). Substandard responders had a larger number of comorbidities (P = .02) and used more opioids (P = .001). Patients recovering from TKA were divided among standard responders (55.8%), poor mental responders (24%), and poor physical responders (20.2%). Poor mental responders were more likely to be female (P = .04) and American Society of Anesthesiologists class III/IV (P = .004). Poor physical responders were more likely to be female (P = .03), younger (P = .04), American Society of Anesthesiologists III/IV (P = .04), use more opioids (P = .02), and be discharged to a nursing facility (P = .001). The THA and TKA models demonstrated areas under the curve of 0.67 and 0.72. Conclusions This multidomain, longitudinal clustering analysis defines 3 distinct patterns in the recovery of THA and TKA patients, with most patients in both cohorts experiencing robust improvement, while others had equally well defined yet less optimal recovery trajectories that were either delayed in recovery or failed to achieve a desired outcome. Patients in the delayed recovery and poor outcome groups were slightly different between THA and TKA. These groups of patients with similar recovery patterns were defined by patient characteristics that include potentially modifiable comorbid factors. This research suggests that there are multiple defined recovery trajectories after THA and TKA, which provides a new perspective on THA and TKA recovery. Level of Evidence III.},

Latent growth modeling approaches, such as latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modeling (GMM), have been increasingly recognized for their usefulness for identifying homogeneous subpopulations within the larger heterogeneous population and for the identification of meaningful groups or classes of individuals. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of LCGA and GMM, compare the different techniques of latent growth modeling, discuss current debates and issues, and provide readers with a practical guide for conducting LCGA and GMM using the Mplus software.},

   abstract = {Background The basis of poor outcomes following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is multifactorial. Previous research aimed at predicting outcome following TKA focuses largely on outcomes measured between two specific time points (pre-to post-TKA). Analysis of outcomes measured over multiple time points (trajectory) may expose relationships between patients’ characteristics and longitudinal outcome patterns that may otherwise remain obscured. Methods The current study analyzed Short Form 36 Physical Component Score (PCS) trajectories of 656 patients composed of 3 time points over a 1-year period. Clusters were constructed utilizing MultiExperiment Viewer hierarchical clustering algorithm. Statistical significance of these clusters was assessed using MeV’s built-in bootstrapping method. Patient characteristics of the resulting statistically conserved clusters were summarized and compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test or chi-squared test as appropriate. Results Two distinct clusters of outcome trajectory were identified. Cluster 1 included 550 patients (84%) who demonstrated persistent PCS improvement at 6 and 12 months. Cluster 2 included 106 patients (16%) who demonstrated decline in PCS at 6 months followed by improvement at 12 months. Cluster 1 achieved earlier success, greater absolute mental and physical health scores as compared to Cluster 2 (P < .05), and demonstrated higher baseline mental health scores, lower baseline PCS, and a significantly higher proportion of non-Hispanic Whites (P ≤ .05). Conclusion Cluster analysis identified distinct functional outcome trajectories following TKA. Specific differentiating patient factors were associated with differing trajectories. Future studies should focus on this method’s ability to inform predictive models regarding patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Study Objective To evaluate patient satisfaction at discharge and 30 days after day surgery, and to identify predictive factors of patient satisfaction. Design Observational, prospective study. Setting Day surgery unit of a university hospital. Patients 251 consecutive patients, aged 43 ± 15 years (56.6% women), scheduled for day surgery. Interventions Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire. Measurements Patients' level of satisfaction was recorded in relation to different variables, using questions of demographics, logistics, and those relating to surgery. Main Results Over 95% of patients were satisfied with their care at both interviews; 74.5% of patients were completely satisfied at the discharge time; and only 62.4% had the same opinion 30 days after the surgery (P < 0.01). Postoperative pain control [odds ratio (OR) = 1.6], waiting time for surgery (OR = 1.4), and patient changing room conditions (OR = 1.3) were the most important factors influencing patient satisfaction at the time of discharge. Clinical outcome (OR = 3.2), clinical information (OR = 1.6), and postoperative pain control (OR = 1.3) were the main factors affecting patient satisfaction 30 days after surgery. Conclusions Overall satisfaction following day surgery was at least 95% at discharge and at 30 days. However, complete satisfaction was present only in 75% at discharge and decreased to 62% at 30 days. Clinical outcome was strongly related to patient satisfaction at 30 days after surgery. Factors directly controlled by anesthesiologists such as postoperative pain and information provided, also had a significant impact on patient satisfaction.},

   abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common surgeries performed to relieve joint pain in patients with end-stage osteoarthritis or rheumatic arthritis of the knee. However, TKA is followed by moderate to severe postoperative pain that affects postoperative rehabilitation, patient satisfaction, and overall outcomes. Historically, opioids have been widely used for perioperative pain management of TKA. However, opioids are associated with undesirable adverse effects, such as nausea, respiratory depression, and retention of urine, which limit their application in daily clinical practice. The aim of this review was to discuss the current postoperative pain management regimens for TKA. Our review of the literature demonstrated that multimodal analgesia is considered the optimal regimen for perioperative pain management of TKA and improves clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction, through a combination of several types of medications and delivery routes, including preemptive analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia, peripheral nerve blockade, patient-controlled analgesia and local infiltration analgesia, and oral opioid/nonopioid medications. Multimodal analgesia provides superior pain relief, promotes recovery of the knee, and reduces opioid consumption and related adverse effects in patients undergoing TKA.},

METHODS: Records of 214 men and 1040 women who underwent primary TKR for end-stage knee OA and were followed up for a minimum of 2 years were reviewed. Knee flexion, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score (KSS), and 8 subscores of Short Form 36 (SF-36) were recorded preoperatively and at postoperative 6 months and 2 years. RESULTS: Men and women were comparable only in age (67.9 vs. 67.3 years, p=0.244); men had a lower mean body mass index (27.0 vs. 28.3 kg/m(2), p<0.001). Preoperatively, men had better knee flexion (117º vs. 114.8º, p=0.05), Oxford Knee Score (33.5 vs. 36.8, p<0.001), KSS knee score (44.3 vs. 40.3, p=0.001), KSS function score (52.5 vs. 47.1, p<0.001), and all 8 subscores of SF-36 (p=0.005 to p<0.001). Compared with men, women achieved greater improvement at 6 months in Oxford Knee score (13.2 vs. 15.1, p=0.009) and KSS knee score (36.9 vs. 41.6, p=0.016), and at 2 years in Oxford Knee Score (15.0 vs. 17.9, p<0.001), KSS knee score (39.8 vs. 43.9, p=0.009), and SF-36 subscores of social functioning (23.6 vs. 35.1, p<0.001) and mental health (3.9 vs. 8.2, p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Compared with men, women had poorer preoperative knee flexion, Oxford Knee Score, KSS, and 8 subscores of SF-36, but achieved greater improvement in the Oxford Knee Score and KSS knee score at 6 months and 2 years, as well as in SF-36 subscores of social functioning and mental health at 2 years.},

   abstract = {Background Day surgery is expanding in several countries, and it is important to collect information about quality. The aim of this study was to assess morbidity and unanticipated hospital visits 0–30 days post-operatively in a large cohort. Methods We prospectively recorded data from 57,709 day surgery procedures performed in eight day surgery centres over a 3-year period. We cross-checked with the National Patient Registry to identify complications 0–30 days post-operatively, and registrations from The Danish Register of Cause of Death were requested. We retrieved the records of 1174 patients to assign a relation between secondary contact and day surgery. Results The overall rate of return hospital visits was 1.21% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12–1.30%] caused by a wide range of diagnoses. No deaths were definitely related to day surgery. The return hospital visits were due to haemorrhage/haematoma 0.50% (95% CI: 0.44–0.56%), infection 0.44% (95% CI: 0.38–0 49%) and thromboembolic events 0.03%. Major morbidity was rare. The surgical procedures with the highest rate of complication were tonsillectomies 11.4%, surgically induced abortions 3.13% and inguinal hernia repairs 1.23%. Conclusion This large-scale Danish national study confirmed that day surgery is associated with a very low rate of return hospital visits. Despite the rapid expansion of day surgery, safety has been maintained, major morbidity being very rare, and no deaths being definitely related to day surgery.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the additional cost attributable to nosocomial infection (NI) in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and related factors. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in all children admitted to the PICU of a tertiary-care pediatric hospital between 2008 and 2009. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted of total direct costs due to PICU stay and medical procedures in patients with and without NI. A log-linear regression model was performed to determine the factors associated with higher total cost. RESULTS: A total of 443 patients were studied and the prevalence of NI was 11.3%. The difference in the median total cost was €30,791.4 per patient between groups with and without NI. The median cost of PICU length of stay in patients with NI was almost eight times higher than the median cost of patients without NI. In patients with NI, the highest costs related to medical procedures were associated with antibiotics, enteral and parenteral feeding, and imaging tests. In the multivariate model, the factors associated with higher cost were infection, the performance of cardiovascular surgery, urgent admission, a higher pediatric risk mortality score, and the presence of immunosuppression. By contrast, older children and those with surgical admission generated lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: NI was associated with an increase in total cost, which implies that the prevention of these infections through specific interventions could be cost-effective and would help to increase the safety of healthcare systems.},

As we move towards personalized medicine, assessing accurate patient subtypes will be a key factor in creating patient specific treatment plans. Partitioning longitudinal trajectories from irregularly spaced and variable length time intervals is a well-established, but open problem. In this work, we present and compare k-means approaches for subtyping opioid use trajectories from EHR data. We then interpret the resulting subtypes using decision trees, examining how each subtype is influenced by opioid medication features and patient diagnoses, procedures, and demographics. Finally, we discuss how the subtypes can be incorporated in static machine learning models as features in predicting opioid overdose and adverse events. The proposed methods are general, and can be extended to other EHR prescription dosage trajectories.},

   abstract = {Background and purpose — The incidence of knee osteoarthritis will most likely increase. We analyzed historical trends in the incidence of knee arthroplasty in Sweden between 1975 and 2013, in order to be able to provide projections of future demand. Patients and methods — We obtained information on all knee arthroplasties in Sweden in the period 1975–2013 from the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register, and used public domain data from Statistics Sweden on the evolution of and forecasts for the Swedish population. We forecast the incidence, presuming the existence of a maximum incidence. Results — We found that the incidence of knee arthroplasty will continue to increase until a projected upper incidence level of about 469 total knee replacements per 105 Swedish residents aged 40 years and older is reached around the year 2130. In 2020, the estimated incidence of total knee arthroplasties per 105 Swedish residents aged 40 years and older will be 334 (95% prediction interval (PI): 281–374) and in 2030 it will be 382 (PI: 308–441). Using officially forecast population growth data, around 17,500 operations would be expected to be performed in 2020 and around 21,700 would be expected to be performed in 2030. Interpretation — Today’s levels of knee arthroplasty are well below the expected maximum incidence, and we expect a continued annual increase in the total number of knee arthroplasties performed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been no study or institution in Ireland promoting major ear surgery performed as a day case procedure in adults. At present, there is a strong political and financial drive for increased elective day case surgery and also a public responsibility to reduce surgical waiting times. METHODS: A prospective study of 43-day case otology patients who underwent major otological surgeries over an 18-month period in a tertiary referral center. We recorded morbidity, readmission rates and assessed the relationships between procedures performed and complications observed. RESULTS: We report a same day discharge rate of 88.4% with a next day readmission rate of 2.3%. We report no major morbidities and found no association between the otological procedure performed and complications observed. Furthermore, there was no statistical association between age and complications observed. We have reduced our waiting list from 9 months to 4 weeks over the 18-month period. CONCLUSION: Major day case otology surgery is an acceptable alternative to an inpatient procedure with favorable discharge rates in comparison to the UK results. Day surgery in this context is safe, cost efficient and expands the surgical possibilities within our department and specialty.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was initiated to improve precision, reduce respondent burden, and enhance the comparability of health outcomes measures. We used item response theory (IRT) to construct and evaluate a preliminary item bank for physical function assuming four subdomains. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from seven samples (N=17,726) using 136 items from nine questionnaires were evaluated. A generalized partial credit model was used to estimate item parameters, which were normed to a mean of 50 (SD=10) in the US population. Item bank properties were evaluated through Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) simulations. RESULTS: IRT requirements were fulfilled by 70 items covering activities of daily living, lower extremity, and central body functions. The original item context partly affected parameter stability. Items on upper body function, and need for aid or devices did not fit the IRT model. In simulations, a 10-item CAT eliminated floor and decreased ceiling effects, achieving a small standard error (< 2.2) across scores from 20 to 50 (reliability >0.95 for a representative US sample). This precision was not achieved over a similar range by any comparable fixed length item sets. CONCLUSION: The methods of the PROMIS project are likely to substantially improve measures of physical function and to increase the efficiency of their administration using CAT.},

Study Design and Setting The items were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative methods. A total of 16,065 adults answered item subsets (n>2,200/item) on the Internet, with oversampling of the chronically ill. Classical test and item response theory methods were used to evaluate 149 PROMIS PF items plus 10 Short Form-36 and 20 Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index items. A graded response model was used to estimate item parameters, which were normed to a mean of 50 (standard deviation [SD]=10) in a US general population sample. Results The final bank consists of 124 PROMIS items covering upper, central, and lower extremity functions and instrumental activities of daily living. In simulations, a 10-item computerized adaptive test (CAT) eliminated floor and decreased ceiling effects, achieving higher measurement precision than any comparable length static tool across four SDs of the measurement range. Improved psychometric properties were transferred to the CAT's superior ability to identify differences between age and disease groups. Conclusion The item bank provides a common metric and can improve the measurement of PF by facilitating the standardization of patient-reported outcome measures and implementation of CATs for more efficient PF assessments over a larger range.},

It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. This new instrument was tested for its psychometric properties in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome, psychology students, medical students, army recruits and junior physicians. We determined the dimensional structure using confirmatory factor analyses (LISREL's unweighted least squares method). The hypothesized five-factor model appeared to fit the data in all samples tested (AGFIs > 0.93). The instrument was found to have good internal consistency, with an average Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.84. Construct validity was established after comparisons between and within groups, assuming differences in fatigue based on differences in circumstances and/or activity level. Convergent validity was investigated by correlating the MFI-scales with a Visual Analogue Scale measuring fatigue (0.22 < r < 0.78). Results, by and large, support the validity of the MFI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the worldwide rising obesity epidemic and the aging population, it is essential to deliver (cost-)effective care that results in enhanced societal participation among knee arthroplasty patients. The purpose of this study is to describe the development, content, and protocol of our (cost-)effectiveness study that assesses a perioperative integrated care program, including a personalized eHealth app, for knee arthroplasty patients aimed to enhance societal participation post-surgery compared to care as usual. METHODS: The intervention will be tested in a multicentre randomized controlled trial with eleven participating Dutch medical centers (i.e., hospitals and clinics). Working patients on the waiting-list for a total- or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with the intention to return to work after surgery will be included. After pre-stratification on medical centre with or without eHealth as usual care, operation procedure (total- or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty) and recovery expectations regarding return to work, randomization will take place at the patient-level. A minimum of 138 patients will be included in both the intervention and control group, 276 in total. The control group will receive usual care. On top of care as usual, patients in the intervention group will receive an intervention consisting of three components: 1) a personalized eHealth intervention called ikHerstel ('I Recover') including an activity tracker, 2) goal setting using goal attainment scaling to improve rehabilitation and 3) a referral to a case-manager. Our main outcome is quality of life, based on patient-reported physical functioning (using PROMIS-PF). (Cost-)effectiveness will be assessed from a healthcare and societal perspective. Data collection has been started in 2020 and is expected to finish in 2024. DISCUSSION: Improving societal participation for knee arthroplasty is relevant for patients, health care providers, employers and society. This multicentre randomized controlled trial will evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a personalized integrated care program for knee arthroplasty patients, consisting of effective intervention components based on previous studies, compared to care as usual.

   abstract = {Summary Estimating pre-operative mortality risk may inform clinical decision-making for peri-operative care. However, pre-operative mortality risk prediction models are rarely implemented in routine clinical practice. High predictive accuracy and clinical usability are essential for acceptance and clinical implementation. In this systematic review, we identified and appraised prediction models for 30-day postoperative mortality in non-cardiac surgical cohorts. PubMed and Embase were searched up to December 2022 for studies investigating pre-operative prediction models for 30-day mortality. We assessed predictive performance in terms of discrimination and calibration. Risk of bias was evaluated using a tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability of prediction model studies. To further inform potential adoption, we also assessed clinical usability for selected models. In all, 15 studies evaluating 10 prediction models were included. Discrimination ranged from a c-statistic of 0.82 (MySurgeryRisk) to 0.96 (extreme gradient boosting machine learning model). Calibration was reported in only six studies. Model performance was highest for the surgical outcome risk tool (SORT) and its external validations. Clinical usability was highest for the surgical risk pre-operative assessment system. The SORT and risk quantification index also scored high on clinical usability. We found unclear or high risk of bias in the development of all models. The SORT showed the best combination of predictive performance and clinical usability and has been externally validated in several heterogeneous cohorts. To improve clinical uptake, full integration of reliable models with sufficient face validity within the electronic health record is imperative.},

However, a systematic overview is missing. The objective of this study was to examine which psychological factors influence the outcome of TKA and THA and to what extent. Methods Data were obtained from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to January 2011. Search terms included TKA and THA, outcome measures, and psychological aspects. Two reviewers independently selected the studies. Studies with a prospective before–after design with a minimum follow-up time of 6 weeks were included. One reviewer extracted the results and 2 reviewers independently conducted quality assessment. We distinguished between follow-up shorter and equal or longer than 1 year. Results Thirty-five of 1837 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. In follow-ups shorter than 1 year, and for knee patients only, strong evidence was found that patients with pain catastrophizing reported more pain postoperatively. Furthermore, strong evidence was found that preoperative depression had no influence on postoperative functioning. In long-term follow-up, 1 year after TKA, strong evidence was found that lower preoperative mental health (measures with the SF-12 or SF-36) was associated with lower scores on function and pain. For THA, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found. Conclusions Low preoperative mental health and pain catastrophizing have an influence on outcome after TKA. With regard to the influence of other psychological factors and for hip patients, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found.},

   abstract = {Latent class analysis (LCA) is a statistical procedure used to identify qualitatively different subgroups within populations who often share certain outward characteristics. The assumption underlying LCA is that membership in unobserved groups (or classes) can be explained by patterns of scores across survey questions, assessment indicators, or scales. The application of LCA is an active area of research and continues to evolve. As more researchers begin to apply the approach, detailed information on key considerations in conducting LCA is needed. In the present article, we describe LCA, review key elements to consider when conducting LCA, and provide an example of its application.},

   abstract = {Several studies show that the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program reduces complications postoperatively and leads to faster recovery and shorter hospital stays. However, little is known about patients’ self-reported health in an enhanced recovery context. The aim of this study was firstly to describe patient experiences of health within the concept of ERAS after colorectal (CR) surgery during a hospital stay and within 2 weeks of discharge. Secondly, to explore whether the ASA classification/co-morbidity, sex, and surgical method affect the patient’s experience of health.},

   abstract = {Objective To review homogeneous subgroups with a distinct course of clinical outcomes, to review the course of clinical outcomes in the study population as a whole, where applicable, and to determine the patient characteristics associated with the distinct courses after total knee or hip arthroplasty. Methods MEDLINE and PsycInfo databases were searched for relevant studies. Selection criteria were patients ≥18 years old, patients at high risk of or diagnosed with knee or hip osteoarthritis, studies aiming to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories or describe the mean change of clinical outcomes, and methodology and analysis designed to identify trajectories (longitudinal design and repeated measures). Results Of the 5,128 abstracts retrieved, 23 met inclusion criteria. Most studies (12 of 23) focused on the mean course of outcomes after knee arthroplasty, and the most frequent outcomes reported were pain and physical function. Statistical approaches used, the number of trajectories, and predictors identified were heterogeneous across studies. Strong evidence was found that female sex, a high body mass index, poor mental health, a high number of painful sites, high preoperative pain level, a low preoperative lower-extremity functioning, and knee arthroplasty were predictors of bad evolution. Conclusion Few studies have used trajectory analysis to describe the course of clinical outcomes in homogeneous subgroups of patients. Yet this approach could lead to the identification of predictors of poor postsurgery outcomes that are specific to patients and thus to earlier identification of poor responders to total arthroplasty.},
